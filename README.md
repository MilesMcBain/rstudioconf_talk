## Title:
Our Colour of Magic: The open sourcery of fantastic R packages

## Abstract:
What does it mean to say software is, to quote one Twitter user, ‘so f***ing magical!’? In the context of our popular community hobby of rating and sharing R packages, the term ‘magic’ seems reserved for our most powerful expressions of visceral approval. Why is this? And what does it say about how we value software? Can this magical quality be quantified? We will consider these questions in examination of magical specimens, and in the process reveal the surprising depths at which notions of magic are embedded in the R zeitgeist.
